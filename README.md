# course-material
This folder contains the material used in the course for Python Programming given by MAMBA (www.mamba-python.nl). 

The philosophy of this course is that the best way to learn Python is by solving practical problems. A good way to do this is by doing exercises in Jupyter Notebooks. The exercises for this are in the 'Exercise_notebooks' folder.
