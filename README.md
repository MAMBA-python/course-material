# course-material
This folder contains the material used in the course for Python Programming given by MAMBA (www.mamba-python.nl). 

The philosophy of this course is that the best way to learn Python is by solving practical problems. A good way to do this is by doing exercises in Jupyter Notebooks. Everyone using Python should learn the basics, the exercises for this are in the 'Exercise_notebooks\Basic' folder. After you've learned the basics there are many specific subject that you should only learn if you can and will use them. These exercises are listed by topic in the 'Exercise_notebooks\On-topic' folder.

The topics have different levels of difficulty. To give a fast indication the level of difficulty and the prerequisites per notebook are listed in the 'notebook_overview.xlsx' file.
