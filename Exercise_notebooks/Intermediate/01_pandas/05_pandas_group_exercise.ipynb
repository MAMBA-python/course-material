    "This notebook contains 8 exercises with pandas. The exercises can be done individually or as a group. For the first 4 exercises (1.1 - 1.4) we use the IMDB top 1000 dataset. The other 4 exercises (2.1 - 2.4) use the covid-19 vaccine dataset. At the top of each of the 4 exercises there is code to obtain a DataFrame of the dataset.\n",
    "    \n",
    "The goal is to use the most efficient (in terms of computation time) Python code to obtain what is asked. You can use the [`%%timeit` jupyter command](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/01.07-timing-and-profiling.html) to get the average execution time of a cell. Please be aware that variables created in a cell with `%%timeit` on top are not stored in memory and cannot be used later on. Therefore it is advised to write the code first and only use `%%timeit` in the end when you are sure the code does what it is supposed to do.\n",

    "For each exercise some stackoverflow posts that could be helpfull have been listed on the bottom of this page."
