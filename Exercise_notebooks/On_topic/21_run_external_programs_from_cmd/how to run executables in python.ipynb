Luckily there is another module that does give you more error information, this is the `subprocess` module. With `subprocess` you can run commands and obtain the errors and output. The syntax is a bit different. The commands are now entered as a list of strings. In this we create a variable `p` as a handle for the process. We obtain the output and errors of the command using `p.communicate`.
