    "### A bit about packages\n",
    "A package is a set of Python functions. When we want to use a function from a package, we need to import it. There are many different ways to import packages. The most basic syntax is\n",
    "\n",
    "`import numpy`\n",
    "\n",
    "after which any function in `numpy` can be called as `numpy.function()`. If you don't like the name of the package, for example because it is long, you can change the name. The `numpy` package is renamed to `np` by typing\n",
    "\n",
    "`import numpy as np`\n",
    "\n",
    "after which all functions in `numpy` can be called as `np.function()`. \n",
    "\n",
    "Packages can also have subpackages. For example, the `numpy` package has a subpackage called `random`, which has a bunch of functions to deal with random variables. If the `numpy` package is imported with `import numpy as np`, functions in the `random` subpackage can be called as `np.random.function()`. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you only need one specific function, you don't have to import the entire package. For example, if you only want the cosine function of the numpy package, you may import it as `from numpy import cos`, after which you can simply call the cosine function as `cos()`. You can even rename functions when you import them. For example, after `from numpy import cos as newname`, you can call the function `newname()` to compute the cosine (I know, pretty silly, but this can become handy). \n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous Notebooks we always imported `numpy` and called it `np` and we imported the `matplotlib.pyplot` and called it `plt`. Both are standard names in the Python community. The statement we added before importing `matplotlib` is `%matplotlib inline`. This latter command is an IPython command and not a Python command. It will only work in IPython and is called a magic command. All magic commands are preceded with a `%`. The statement `%matplotlib inline` puts all figures in the Notebook rather than in a separate window. \n",

We already learned about two of them: variables passed to the function through the argument list, like `x` in the function above, and local variables, like `a` and `b` in the function above. The third type are variables defined outside the function but not passed to the function through the argument list. When a variable is used inside a Python function, Python first checks whether the variable has been defined locally. If not, it checks whether the variable is passed to the function through the argument list. And if that is not the case, Python checks whether the variable is defined outside the function, from the place the function was called. If that is not the case either, it will throw an error message. It is considered good coding practice to pass variables to a function when they are needed inside a function, rather than counting on Python to *find* the variable outside the function; it will likely lead to fewer coding errors as well.\n",
