Create an array of 12 zeros to store the monthly totals and loop through all the days in 2012 to compute the total rainfall for each month. The month associated with each row of the DataFrame may be obtained with the `.month` syntax, as shown above. Print the monthly totals (in mm/month) to the screen and create a bar graph of the total monthly rainfall (in mm/month) vs. the month using the `plt.bar` function of matplotlib. "

    "### Resampling\n",
    "DataFrames have a very powerful feature called resampling. Downsampling refers to going from high frequency to low frequency. For example, going from daily data to monthly data. Upsampling refers to going from low frequency to high frequency. For example going from monthly data to daily data. For both upsampling and downsampling, you need to tell `pandas` how to perform the resampling. Here we discuss downsampling, where we compute monthly totals from daily values. First we load the daily rainfall in Rotterdam in 2012 from the file `rotterdam_rainfall_2012.txt` and specify the dates as the index (this is the column labeled as YYYYMMDD). We resample the rain to monthly totals using the `resample` function. You have to tell the `resample` function to what frequency it needs to resample. Common ones are `'A'` for yearly, `'M'` for monthly, `'W'` for weekly, `'D'` for daily, and `'H'` for hourly, but there are many other ones (see  [here](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/version/0.12.0/timeseries.html)). The keyword argument `kind` is used to tell `pandas` where to assign the computed values to. You can assign the computed value to the last day of the period, or the first day, or to the entire period (in this case the entire month). The latter is done by specifying `kind='period'`, which is what we will do here.  Finally, you need to specify how to resample. This is done by adding a `numpy` function at the end of the resample statement, like\n",
    "\n",
    "    dataframe.resample(...).npfunc()\n",
    "    \n",
    "where `npfunc` can be any `numpy` function like `mean` for the mean (that is the default), `sum` for the total, `min`, `max`, etc. Calculating the monthly totals and making a bar graph can now be done with `pandas` as follows. "
